# Front-End-Web-UI-Frameworks-and-Tools
This project is a result of finishing "Front-End Web Development with React" course. Simple website created with usage of React, Reactstrap and Redux.

## Description
The project is an example website for restaurant which demonstrates Javascript based front-end application development, and in particular the React library. It contains as well examples of use of Reactstrap for Bootstrap 4-based responsive UI design. It shoes various aspects of React component, React router and its use in developing single-page applications and, finally, useage of Fetch for client-server communication. It also contains example usage of controlled forms, introduction to the Redux and its usege to develop React-Redux powered applications. Lastly, this project contains example of simple usages of React animation support.
To summarise this project shows my:

- Familiarity with client-side Javascript application development and the React library
- Ability to implement single page applications in React
- Ability to use various React features including components and forms
- Ability to implement a functional front-end web application using React
- Ability to use Reactstrap for designing responsive React applications
- Ability to use Redux to design the architecture for a React-Redux application

## Course assignments
The website contains following assignments completed and marked as 100% :
- #### Assignment 1: React Components

- #### Assignment 2: React Router and Single Page Applications

- #### Assignment 3: React Forms and Redux

- #### Assignment 4: Redux, Client-Server Communication and Fetch

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
